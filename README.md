# Enhanced Environmental Perception System For Visual Impaired Person 


## Abstract
The visually impaired community faces numerous obstacles in their daily lives, limiting their ability to interact effectively with their surroundings. To address these challenges, modern technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Image Recognition, and Text Recognition offer promising solutions to bridge the accessibility gap and empower visually impaired individuals with increased independence and autonomy.

This project aims to develop a comprehensive solution leveraging AI and ML algorithms for real-time environmental perception and information retrieval. Through the use of image recognition techniques, the system will provide visually impaired individuals with auditory feedback, allowing them to access information about their surroundings in real-time. By employing advanced image processing and text recognition algorithms, the system will interpret visual cues from the environment and convert them into audible descriptions. This functionality will enable users to navigate and interact with their surroundings confidently, enhancing their overall quality of life.


## Objective and Functionalities 

The main idea of this project is to implement a Web-based application that provides a
way for visually impaired people to interact and understand their surroundings. It would
focus on tools that can help these people, which includes:
1. **Object Detection:**
<br>The idea is to build an application that would detect the object present in
front of the webcam or camera in our computer or smartphone and can tell
the information about the objects to the user in the form of voice.
2. **Face Recognition:**
<br>The idea is to build an application that would recognize the person present in front of the webcam or camera in our computer or smartphone and can tell the information about the objects to the user in the form of voice.
3. **Voice assistant:**
<br>The idea is to build an assistant that can take the input of a user in the
form of voice and can perform some basic tasks like searching on the
web, switching the feature in the web app, etc.
4. **Image to text/speech:**
<br>The idea is to make the words recognition system that can extract words
from the given input image and display them in the form of text and
produces an output in the form of voice.
5. **Speech to text:**
<br>The idea is to construct a speech recognition system that would listen to
the user’s speech and convert it into text. This would be a great tool that
would help the visually impaired person to write a kind of information by
just saying it.
6. **Text to Speech:**
<br>The idea here is to convert the text into speech. This will help the user to
read anything by just passing the text in the application, and the
application would read on behalf of the user. <br><br>
